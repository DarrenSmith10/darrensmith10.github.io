## Context

I built a modern, responsive portfolio website using Next.js for a client working in textiles and fashion. The goal of the site is to establish a strong online presence that highlights her visibility, creativity, and professional credibility within the fashion industry.

The website showcases a curated range of fashion products, including wool items, hats, and other textile-based pieces, presented through a clean, elegant, and user-focused design. Emphasis was placed on visual storytelling and accessibility across all devices.

This project was also a key learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of React, Tailwind CSS, responsive design principles, and deployment workflows, while building a real-world, client-focused application.

### Actions  {#overview-actions}

- 💡 Potential improvements:
  1. Add more components such as Gallery Carousal to make the page more interesting.

  2. Add more fashion items to the projects and fill in the about page when client is ready.

  3. Contact page needs more work and project routing needs more work in the future.
