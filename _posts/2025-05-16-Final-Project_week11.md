## Context

In a group of 3 we built online e-learning portal for photography enthusiasts. 

This  was doing using React/Node app which contains the code for an online e-learning portal for users interested in developing photography skills through online courses.

The project includes user signup/login, a node back-end of course and user data, and a React front-end which presents the user with the information to view course information, sign up and view a gallery of previous learners work.


### Actions  {#overview-actions}
- 🔹 **Step 1:** Collabareted and decided roles and responsiblities for each team member.
- 🔹 **Step 2:** Produced a Wireframe and Planning of the website. 
- 🔹 **Step 3:** Start building the front end (Main page while lialising with other team members working on the back end.) 
- 🔹 **Step 4:** Create the Log in / Sign up page and make sure connects to the backend that stores all the users details and make sure its autheticated with tokens(JWIT).
- 🔹 **Step 5:** Making sure the course and lessons and review pages are connected to the backend. This was done by checking and reconnecting the routes on the back end and front end (Axios)
