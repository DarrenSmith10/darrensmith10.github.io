## Context

I carried out a data analysis project using real-world sample data to examine the number of volunteers with multiple skills. This project served as a demonstration of what I learned during a volunteer placement with the charity DataKind. It allowed me to test and validate data workflows before applying them to live datasets. As the original project was confidential, this version is a simplified simulation that showcases the tools and processes used. The project was completed using Python, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI.

### Actions  {#overview-actions}
- 🔹 **Step 1:** Clean the database and remove duplicates, missing numbers and remove columns to reduce the file size.
- 🔹 **Step 2:** Use Jupiter Notebook /Python to read in the files look through the data. 
- 🔹 **Step 3:** Visualize the data using Power BI and create plots. 
- 🔹 **Step 4:** Looked at the trends and then put the results on Power BI to create a dashboard.
